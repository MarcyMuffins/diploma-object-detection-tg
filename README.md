# Diploma project by Oleksii Verkhola

## An object detection system using YOLOv11 running on a telegram bot

The project consists of three parts:
1. An ESP32-CAM web-server broadcasting an MJPEG stream as an output from the camera.
2. An interactive python script that trains a YOLOv11 model on the selected RoboFlow dataset and outputs a .pt trained model file.
3. A fully functional Telegram bot that notifies the user of detected objects, allowing the user to select the model used.
